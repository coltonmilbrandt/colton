# Colton Milbrandt | Blockchain Developer

Welcome to my personal website! I am a blockchain developer with seven years of experience in finance and tech. I enjoy using my skills to create finance-related applications, such as my Solidity-built market launching AMM, Gwin. I also successfully funded and launched my own company, Rent Buddy, an all-in-one rental property management app that used Java and Angular.js.
